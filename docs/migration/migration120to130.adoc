= 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0

== reactive-messaging-redisstream-connector

* Introduced additional config options for outgoing producers in order to fine-tune backpressure and handle fire-and-forget scenarios.

=== Migration

* The connector now defaults to 3 retries for outgoing messages. If you want to keep the previous behavior of no retries, you need to set `retries` to `0` in your configuration.
